# ‚ö° Power System Fault Detection and Classification Using Machine Learning

This project is focused on detecting and classifying different types of faults in a power distribution system using machine learning. It uses voltage and current phasor data to distinguish between normal operation and fault conditions such as Line-to-Ground (L-G), Line-to-Line (L-L), and Three-Phase faults.

The model was built using **IBM Watsonx.ai AutoAI**, trained on a public Kaggle dataset, and deployed on **IBM Cloud Lite** for real-time testing.

## üìä Problem Statement

Fault detection in power systems is critical for grid stability and reliability. Traditional methods are slow and reactive. This project proposes an ML-based solution that can rapidly and accurately detect faults from live system parameters.
